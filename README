This was supposed to be a simple and easy to use image editor that can work with
all types of images as well other formats like pdf. It would allow users to
edit a single image or bulk images easily. This solution was supposed to be
cross-platform.

It uses:
    C++ for back-end
        ImageMagick for processing
    QML for front-end


This repository will be archived as I have decided to instead find some other
and more minimal solution to get over this issue.
